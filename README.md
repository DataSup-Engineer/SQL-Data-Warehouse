**SQL DATA WAREHOUSE & ANALYTICS PROJECT**

Building a comprehensive data warehouse, ETL processes, data modeling and analytical solution to derive insights from the data using MySQL.

**Project Overview**
1. Data Architecture: The Data Warehouse is designed using Medallion Architecture.
2. ETL Pipelines: The process consists of Extracting, Transforming and Loading of data from the source systems into the Data Warehouse.
3. Data Modeling: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
4. Analytics & Reporting: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

**Data Architecture**
In this project, we are following Medalliion Data Architecture, which consists of three phases:
**Bronze Layer:**
this layer is the first layer in the data architecture and loads the data which is in raw unprocesses data as in from sources, used full load method

**Silver Layer:**
this layer is the second layer in the data architecture, makes changes to the data

**Gold Layer:**
this layyer is the third layer in the data architecture, extracts insights from the data and visualizes
